# Flood Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project is a machine learning-based tool that predicts the likelihood of flooding based on various environmental factors. The app utilizes Random Forest regression models to provide predictions based on input data like monsoon intensity, urbanization, deforestation, etc.

## Features

- **Real-Time Flood Prediction**: Users can input environmental factors and get a prediction of the flood probability.
- **Interactive Interface**: Built using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/), allowing easy interaction with the model.
- **Environmental Factors**: Predicts flood risks based on factors like deforestation, urbanization, climate change, drainage systems, and more.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Niyaaea/FloodPrediction.git
